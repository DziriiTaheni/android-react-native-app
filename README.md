# Android React Native app

This repo serves as a reference for integrating React Native into a brand new Android app.

## Setup Android app

- Create a new Android app using the "No Activity" template.
- Set the minimum SDK version to 23
- Deleted the un-used tests.

The app won't run intially as it don't have the `MainApplication` and/or `MainActivity` files. This serves as a starting point for the app.

Next go ahead and create the `MainApplication.java` and `MainActivity.java` classes.
